Titanic survival prediction is a classic machine learning problem that involves analyzing data related to passengers aboard the RMS Titanic and predicting which individuals are likely to survive the ship's sinking disaster. This task typically involves exploring various factors such as passenger demographics, ticket class, cabin location, family relations, and socio-economic status to build predictive models
Problem Statement:
The problem of Titanic survival prediction revolves around developing models to predict whether a passenger survived or not based on historical data. Key challenges include:

Data Exploration and Cleaning: Exploring and preprocessing the dataset to handle missing values, outliers, and inconsistencies in the data.

Feature Engineering: Creating new features or transforming existing ones to extract meaningful information from the dataset, such as extracting titles from passenger names or deriving family size from related variables.

Model Building: Developing and training machine learning models to predict survival outcomes based on input features, such as logistic regression, decision trees, random forests, support vector machines, or neural networks.
